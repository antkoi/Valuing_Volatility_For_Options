**Project Overview
**
This repository explores the use of ARCH and GARCH models for a more accurate approach to valuing volatility in options. These models improve upon traditional methods by accounting for volatility clustering, which helps to create smarter, more responsive volatility estimates for pricing and risk management.

**Key Steps in the Notebook
**
**Data Acquisition & Preparation:** Fetched daily stock data for NVIDIA and converted it into percentage returns, a key input for volatility modeling.

**Model Application:** Applied a GJR-GARCH model to the returns data to analyze and forecast volatility, with a focus on capturing market shocks and their impact.

**Result Visualization:** Plotted the model's fitted conditional volatility to visually identify and track periods of high and low market risk.

This approach provides a more dynamic and realistic estimate of market volatility, which is a cornerstone of professional options trading and risk analysis.
